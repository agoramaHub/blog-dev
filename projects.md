<h4><a class="glitch-link" href="/projects/education/"><span class="glitch">Workshops</span></a></h4>
We run practice-led workshops and lectures aimed to support the knowledge and development of a p2p distributed internet. These range from basic html and markdown, self-hosting and distributing content using hypermedia protocols such as DAT or IPFS. All our resources for these sessions can be viewed, seeded and shared in [Education](/education).

<h4><a class="glitch-link" href="/projects/artist-res/"><span class="glitch">Residencies and Exhibitions</span></a></h4>
We aim to open the collaborative nature of Agorama to the artistic community. By inviting 3 creative practitioners to use our workshop and studio at Raven Row, this programme intends to aid the development of new interdisciplinary projects informed by technology and p2p networks. Each artist will be able to use our facilities for a month or longer, receive technical support and mentoring and have access to our network of practitioners. Additionally, the artists are encouraged to use the space for lectures, workshops and performances. The residencies culminate in a final exhibition, an opportunity to showcase the new works developed.
