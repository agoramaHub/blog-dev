We hosted a working research group into the distributed p2p (peer-to-peer) web at our studio at Raven Row between Sep 2018 - June 2019. The aim was to foster a community interested in experimenting, developing and maintaining a distributed Internet infrastructure. We organised public workshops at Mozilla festival, free university and some european universitys and colleges. The research manifested in a number of creative applications and interpretation of p2p internet culture and some documented code for turning raspberry pi's into p2p web servers that can be found on our [github](https://github.com/agoramaHub/) page and the rest of the research resides here.
