Welcome to Agorama's repository of educational material used for teaching and workshops in developing p2p web applications and self-hosting. Each tutorial has been produced collectively for workshops and group classes. It is recommended to use [Beaker Browser](https://beakerbrowser.com/) (or have a markdown viewer) as all the material is written in markdown. Each tutorial can be forked and edited for your own use.
