### Agorama Projects and Commissions

[Swayze effect](https://www.facebook.com/events/356154235293765/) presented the works produced as a result of Agorama’s 2019 Artistic Residencies & Exhibitions Programme. Hazel Brill, James Irwin and Tamara Kametani were invited to use Agorama’s studio at Raven Row from April 2019 to conceive new work informed by technology. Through collaboration and computer programming, this residency aimed to provide the artists with access to digital tools for the development of their practices. Exhibition hosted by [Platform Southwark](http://www.platformsouthwark.co.uk/whatson/).

[Moses the Lonely Londoner](https://moses-aloetta.agorama.org.uk/?fbclid=IwAR1gv535U60KmlbmkNNgepHSyik6n1IMEu3gsi6uuMW3UhCZxd3d1Tp9RoI) is a project set on investigating the concept of intimate digital spaces, namely that of the [telecocoon](http://cyborganthropology.com/Tele-Cocooning) which was first detailed in Japanese teen keitai culture as an invisible space of intimacy linked together by an individual's mobile device. The project takes inspiration from author Sam Selvon’s novel *The Lonely Londoners* and makes manifest its main character, Moses Aloetta, through the use of Artificial Intelligence. Drawing parallels between the loneliness expressed in Selvon’s 1950s London and the notions of isolation propelled by Social Media, users are invited to connect with Moses on their mobile device and enter his telecocoon. This project was exhibited in the Photographers' Gallery as part of the exhibition [For the Time Being](https://thephotographersgallery.org.uk/for-the-time-being), and was commissioned by the Royal College of Art in partnership with the Photographers' Gallery.

[Geltung{Validity}: perception of a natural right](http://geltung.agorama.org.uk) - An offline/online project curated by Alejandro Ball, and Inês Costa as part of agorama, a new collaborative Internet platform for art. Featuring Diogo da Cruz, Max Dovey, Felicity Hammond and Petra Szemán whose works mediate political narratives and philosophical questions accelerated by technology and digital culture. This exhibition was in collaboration with GENERATORproject and part of the NEoN Digital Festival 2017, with support from Creative Scotland.  

[The Bank for Argumentation](http://thebankforargumentation.agorama.org.uk/) by Diogo da Cruz - WORDCOIN, proposes the implementation of a new currency, that will give a literal value to each one’s speech. With the realisation of The Bank for Argumentation, the customer/museum-goer will have the opportunity to trust his/her arguments to an institution that can store them and, allow for these arguments to be exchanged with other members of the bank. Project was supported by Creative Scotland.

[I keep forgetting I’ve been to Tokyo: GAIDEN](http://tokyogaiden.agorama.org.uk/) by Petra Szemán - part of a distributed artwork, consisting of a three-channel animation video accompanied by a sound piece, and the above linked website. The context of the project follows a virtual self through parallel and intersecting realities, along the departure-initiation-return of *the hero’s journey*. Drawing upon personal and/or constructed experiences, the online portion explores the idea of a non-localised identity, an archive of accumulated personal mythologies acquired from a multitude of realities. Project was supported by Creative Scotland.
