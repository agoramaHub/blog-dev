Following on from our collaboration with Offsite Projects artist [Catinca Malaimare](https://www.catincamalaimare.com/) is are second artist in residence for our online residency program. 

For her ZIP residency in June Catinca produced 'Lo Sodium' a series of performative rituals that dramatised our complex compansionship with technology through a series of chorographed interactions and a short story.  Catinca situates herself in and around a large pair of stage lights and invites the viewer to explore these majestic mechanical objects in a theatrical sense, delibreately demanding a discomforting intensity from the viewer and asking us to share the awkward physical presence of these regal (but sadly now redundant) tecnological artefacts. 

As part of her residency with us at Agorama Catinca has been experimenting with two JVC space helmet TV's from the 1970s (see image). We are also working with her to devlelop the construction of a new pair of strip lights that can be used in a new performance. 

Catinca is regularly documenting the process on her [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/catincamalaimare/) and the outputs will be shared publically as part of a group show early next year.

[Catinca Malaimare](https://www.catincamalaimare.com/) is a London based artist and current postgraduate student at The Royal Academy of Arts. Performing alongside anthropomorphised technologies, Malaimare’s choreography manifests our intimate relationship with photographic tools and the screens onto which they project our visages.

Malaimare is founder and co-curator of Habeas Corpus (We Have A Body), a platform that aims to provide a testing ground for live and media-based works in contemporary performance art.
