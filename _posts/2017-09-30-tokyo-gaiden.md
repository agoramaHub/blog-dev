excerpt: I keep forgetting I’ve been to Tokyo:GAIDEN is the online accompanying platform for Petra Szemán's three-channel animation video installation of the same title. The project follows the virtual self through parallel and intersecting realities, along the departure-initiation-return structure of The Hero’s Journey. Agorama for this project created a interactive mind-map  based on Petra's travel diary through Japan, which served as the base of inspiration for the 3-channel video.
