This is the first post for agorama's new micro blog web-page.... To celebrate lets take in all of the different examples we can find of *hello world* programming proof of concepts Agorama will be using....
<!--more-->

## HTML/CSS

```
<style>
  h1 {
    font-family: "Courier New", Courier, monospace;
  }

<h1>Hello World!</h1>
```


## JavaScript

```
alert("Hello World!")
```

## PHP

```
<?php
  echo "Hello World!";
?>
```

## Python

```
print "Hello World!"
```

Its a little like learning to say hello in different linguistic languages. How many *hello world* proof of concepts can you call to mind?
