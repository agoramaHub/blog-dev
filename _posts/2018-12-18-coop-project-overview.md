excerpt: We hosted a working research group into the distributed p2p (peer-to-peer) web at our studio at Raven Row between Sep 2018 - June 2019. The aim was to foster a community interested in experimenting, developing and maintaining a distributed Internet infrastructure. We organised public workshops at Mozilla festival, free university and some european universitys and colleges. The research manifested in a number of creative applications and interpretation of p2p internet culture and some documented code for turning raspberry pi's into p2p web servers that can be found on our github page and the rest of the research resides here.
