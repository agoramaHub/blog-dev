excerpt: Agorama established and hosted a working research group into the distributed p2p (peer-to-peer) web at their studio at Raven Row between Sep. 2018 - Jun. 2019. The aim was to foster a community interested in experimenting, developing and maintaining a distributed Internet infrastructure.

We organised public workshops at Mozilla festival, free university and some european universitys and colleges. The research manifested in a number of creative applications and interpretation of p2p internet culture and some documented code for turning raspberry pi's into p2p web servers that can be found on our github page and the rest of the research resides here.

We host regular p2p web meet-ups at our studio at Raven Row for anyone interested in the distributed internet. The aim is to facilitate a community interested in experimenting, developing and maintaining a distributed internet infrastructure. We have been invited to give workshops and lead regular educational programs exploring the potential for a self organized distributed hosting platform for Agorama.
