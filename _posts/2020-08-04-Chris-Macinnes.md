We are very pleased to announce [Christopher Macinnes](http://Christophertophermacinnes.com/) as the first artist to take part in our (online) residency program for 2020. Christopher was selected through our collaboration with [Offsite Projects](http://www.offsiteproject.org/) where he presented [Imagine escape in darkness](http://www.offsiteproject.org/ZIP) which you can dowload and view offline as part of their ZIP residency program.

Christopher MacInnes is an artist based in London. Taking computing and networks as a starting point he works with software, hardware and occasionally organisms. Using the diverse vectors of our planetary networks, MacInnes attempts to trace the mycellenic tangle of chaotic phenomena across platforms, landscapes and bio-synthetic ecologies.

We have begun working with Christopher to help develop and realise a multiplayer online game in which the audience will explore a an imagined world full of mystical artefacts and aspects of techno-spirtuality and gnosticism. The game is already looking really exciting, see some of the images below and Christopher has been developing the environment using three.js, websockets and node and we will hopefully be sharing some technical guides to accompany the new work for those interested very soon.
