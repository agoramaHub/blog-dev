Over the summer Alejandro lent a hand to help develop [Shinji Toya](https://shinjitoya.com/) latest interactive art project.
The project is called [Paint Your Face Away](https://paintyourfaceaway.net) and invites the audience to distort their own self portrait using face-painting and masking techniques. We have been friends wth Shinji for a few years now and the project has had some different iterations in the form of workshop sessions so it was neat that he asked us if we could help with some aspects of the web development to turn it into a web application.

Through interacting with the tool audiences are able to learn when a face is no longer a face in the eyes of facial recognition software and contribute to an alternative facial database of adverserial self-portraits.
