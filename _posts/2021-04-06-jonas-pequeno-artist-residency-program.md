Residency Reflections on Jonas Pequeno's residency 'Gardens in Computers'

Jonas has taken part in the Agorama X Offsite Residency program using the time to develop his archival practice and explore the application of databases in machine learning to reflect on the production of knowledge and representation in A.I. Jonas exerts the limits of language as an interface for classification and cascades through the parameters of logic used within A.I. architecture, exploring the cracks in semantics between human and computational reason to fall into absurd realms of reality.

As part of the residency Jonas has been navigating representations of ‘nature’ from the perspective of the database, initially beginning with sound, Jonas indexed thousands of instances of representations of ‘nature’ from the user generated archives such as freesound.org, archive.org and flickr. The process of collating an extensive amount of media objects allowed Jonas to critically reflect on both the semantic boundaries of these data sets and the materiality of the data. The limits of language to classify natural phenomenon became central to the outputs of the residency, the sonic  artefacts of the sea transposed into artificially generated ambient shores, thousands of flower specimens re-grounded into 3d generated turf and portraits of the sky with clouds automatically removed.

The French impressionist painter Henri Rousseau is most well known for his paintings of jungle scenes & detailed flora, but the artist’s knowledge of tropical plants came mostly from the botanical gardens in Paris as the artist is known to have never left his homeland France. The residency has been forced to be completed through various stages of lockdown, Jonas has similarly summoned an imagined notion of the term ‘nature’, from the position of an machine learning model that narrates its discoveries by continually parsing through symbolic meanings in a never ending daisy chain of potential understandings.
