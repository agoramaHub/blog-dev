excerpt: Post-Internet Lanscapes (PIL) is the first manifestation of agorama and the product of a collaboration between Juan Crespo, Enrique Tutor and amaCollective. It consists of a website that takes the form of a virtual institution. PIL explores the possibilities of .gif and meme formats as a material suitable for artistic and cultural discourse, taking advantage of new media features through collection and archival methods. Based on ideas such as anachronism, dialogue, popular culture, disruption or folklore and behavior migrations, the project questions how these tendencies can interpret the vast cultural and creative internet manifestations, developing new approaches to social, historical or political points of view.
