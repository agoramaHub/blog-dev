Agorama is pleased to announce that we have been selected to be one of 10 residence based at Raven Row gallery! We are extremely pleased at this turn of events and honour to have been selected.

We have been situated on the 4th floor of the historical building in **Rebecca's Flat** - a visually eccentric space with loads of character.

During our tenancy we will be striving to create a sustainable community around p2p technology, by delivering workshops and working closely with artists on a programme of residencies and exhibitions. Just think antique switch boards and DIY networks!

Stay tune for more news, events and workshops and be usher out our programme.
