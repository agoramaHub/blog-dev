Agorama is Alejandro Ball, InÃªs Costa, Max Dovey and Anna Viani, a London based collective of creative practitioners focusing on the critical exploration of digital network culture through public events, artist residencies, exhibitions and collective research groups, currently in Residency at [Raven Row](http://www.ravenrow.org/), London.

As part of our core mission we run three main threads of activities: [Server Co-op](/tag/p2p) that aims to establish a p2p distributed platform for artist experimentation and develop a grass-roots autonomous model for digital communication; [Workshops](/projects/education/) that focus on digital literacy, providing practitioners with guides and tools to learn from and expand their practice and [Residencies & Exhibitions](/projects/artist-res/) to aid the development of new interdisciplinary projects informed by technology and p2p networks by inviting other creative practitioners to use our facilities for a month or longer, receive technical support and mentoring.
